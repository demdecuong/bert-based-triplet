5,15,What  should I consider when using nursing-home care,"A skilled nursing facility offers complete care. Such places are set up to handle patients who are bedridden and require 24-hour assistance. 
Skilled nursing facilities are carefully regulated by the states. Many are certified for Medicare and Medicaid.
Whether you’re anticipating a short stay or a permanent placement in a nursing home, the search for the best facility is important. The care and wellbeing of a loved one is at stake, and there are many factors to consider from location to cost to quality of the professionals who work there."
6,15,What is the cost for nursing-home care service,"The cost of nursing-home care runs about $150 to $250 dollars a day. That’s $4,500 to $7,500 per month. That doesn’t include the cost of medications, which are added to the bill. There are different cost levels depending on the work required for the nurses and aides. Check whether you’re locked into a minimum stay. Also, verify whether the facilities are Medicare or Medicaid certified if that’s important to your needs."
7,15,How can we evaluate assisted-living facilities,"Assisted-living facilities go by a number of different names: personal-care homes, adult homes, retirement residences, and group homes, to name a few.
These facilities may offer help with bathing, dressing, meals, and housekeeping. 
They also offer a safe environment for individuals who are beginning to lose their memory.
They may not be as tightly regulated as nursing homes, so there may be greater disparity in quality of services and facility. 
A careful inspection is equally important when considering an assisted-living facility to be sure your needs match with their services."
8,15,What is the cost for assisted-living facilities,"You might pay $2,500 to $5,000 per month, depending on what you get. 
It is important to keep your focus on your prioritized list of needs. 
what is included in the basic fees."
9,15,What should I do if I get bad assisted-living stuffs,"Because assisted-living facilities are not closely regulated, it is harder to discover problems, and resolving them is not as easy. 
You should at least ask about the process for resolving complaints and working out ways to meet special needs that aren’t currently anticipated. 
This is one thing you should definitely talk to others at the facility and their family members about."
10,16,What are challenges for stroke while recovery,"make recovery or adjustment to life with stroke just a little more of a challenge: painful muscle spasms and contractures, driving limitations, depression and other psychological conditions, swallowing difficulties, and incontinence."
11,16,What is muscle spasticity problem while recovery,"It typically kicks in several months after the stroke and affects approximately 20 percent of stroke patients. What happens is this: 
Muscles that are weak become tense and contract abnormally, resulting in severe and painful spasms. 
Spasticity does not seem to be related to severity of stroke.
With stroke and muscles, you are likely to think more of paralysis than of overactive muscles. 
But overactivity is exactly what is happening with spasticity. 
Here’s what’s going on: Say you’re at the doctor, and she taps your knee tendon with her hammer. 
Nerves from the tendon carry electrical signals to the spinal cord. 
A normal brain receives these signals and reduces the speed and strength of the built-in rate of the electrical activity transferred back to the muscles. "
12,16,What is muscle freeze problem,"Serious problems can develop when muscles become frozen in position and can’t be straightened out. These rigid muscles are called contractures. 
Unless a person diligently stretches out these tight muscles, sometimes against a lot of resistance, they may become frozen in unusual postures. "
13,16,Do I might be depressed,"The matter gets even more confused by the high incidence of depression after a stroke. 
You can’t really tell how well you are thinking and planning and controlling your emotions after a stroke until you have taken care of any depression that may be present. 
Depression can make you more emotional, more impulsive, and less apt to plan well and analyze problems. 
Again, you may not be aware you are depressed."
14,16,How can I check whether I got depression,"The ideal solution is to have full neuropsychological and psychiatric evaluations.
The results of the testing should be confirmed by the impressions of the neuropsychologist or psychiatrist. Otherwise, further testing or evaluation may be recommended to understand the results. 
Just like a cholesterol test, some preparations help ensure sound results from the evaluation. 
Get a good night’s sleep and avoid taking the tests if there are specific and acute stressors in your life at that moment so that you can get the most accurate assessment. 
Nobody thinks psychological tests are the only deciding factor.
Many doctors trust their intuition more than tests and will change their clinical diagnosis only if there is clear supporting evidence"
15,16,How to deal with incontinence,"Treatment of both fecal and urinary incontinence involves taking action before the signal to go gets too strong. 
That way you have more time to get yourself to the toilet and you don’t need as much effort from your brain to keep things under control.
Incontinence is more common with severe stroke.
Problems with both types of incontinence tend to clear up within three months of the stroke. 
But when they don’t, serious, longstanding problems are often reasons for deciding to admit someone to a nursing home. 
Even the most dedicated caretaker cannot maintain standards of hygiene if your mobility is limited and you remain incontinent for an extended time."
16,16,How common fecal incontinence is,"Like most medical conditions, when you start talking about fecal incontinence, you find it’s more common than you might have suspected. 
A couple of studies have indicated that fecal incontinence, either frequent or occasional, occurred in about 30 percent of stroke patients in the first seven to ten days after stroke. This improved to only 10 percent at three months to a year. There was a slight increase to 15 percent by three years. 
It is most common in stroke patients who have some degree of dementia"
17,16,What are notice for nursing home solution,"One thing is for sure, if you and your caretaker cannot handle the problem
well, poor hygiene rapidly leads to other major health problems. You will
likely end up back in the hospital or in a nursing home. Fecal incontinence is
also a serious burden for a caretaker, greatly increasing the chances of
depression and physical exhaustion. If you can’t get the problem resolved
fairly quickly, a temporary or permanent move to a nursing home has to be
considered sooner rather than later."
18,16,Sign of troubles after a week stroke,"A week after a stroke, about 10 percent of stroke patients choke when eating.
Approximately 30 percent experience abnormal swallowing. This adds up to
40 percent of stroke patients with an increased rate of death, due in part to
pneumonia from food that is inhaled into the lungs. Signs of trouble:
Choking or coughing while eating
Slow chewing and swallowing
Food stuck in mouth
Chest congestion
Gurgle-like sound to the voice"
19,17,What should I ask myself to evaluate stroke my situation,"You may have to ask some hard questions of yourself and others: 
Are you a difficult patient? 
Have you been angry, emotional, demanding, or otherwise hard to be around? 
Are you critical of your caregiver and others in the household? 
Do you have unreasonable expectations? 
Are you following the advice of the health pros and doing your exercises and taking medications? 
Is your caregiver able to meet your needs consistently? 
Is your caregiver meeting his or her needs as well?
The answers to these questions will give you a good idea of whether you need help. If you are not getting better, then you are risking your remaining independence by continuing to try and go it alone. 
You can do a lot to get back on the path to recovery, but you and your family may need to ask for help."
20,17,How can I prevent the caregiver burnout,"’m sure you’ve got the idea. What can be done? Plenty! 
When the stroke survivor and the caregiver become aware of the risks in their situation and that the challenges are nobody’s fault they can work together to find solutions. Here are just a few recommendations
Invite help from friends and familyI
Find a daycare facility
Join a stroke support group
Turn to adult children
Connect with other caregivers
Renew friendships and activities
Get caregiver training
Get a good long-distance plan
Make a doctor appointment"
21,17,What if the caregiver needs medical care?,"What will happen if your caregiver is temporarily disabled by an illness? A
frank discussion opens an opportunity to anticipate difficulties and take steps
to make two lives less stressful. Knowing that you have a contingency plan in
case your caregiver becomes sick may give both of you peace of mind and,
in turn, reduce anxiety that can lead to illness."
22,17,Should I go home from the hospital immediately after stroke,"If you go home from the hospital or rehabilitation unit after a stroke, you are not prepared for
how difficult your life and your caregiver’s life can become."
23,17,What are potential causes by stroke,"Stroke often causes personality change
Stroke causes depression
Stroke causes dementia
Stroke can make you unaware of your disabilities"
24,17,What are some limitations of stoke,"Just as you will benefit from recognizing that you can get yourself from bed to bathroom if you continue your physical therapy, but you can’t drive responsibly, your spouse will benefit from learning those same distinctions. 
A 70-year-old woman may be able to help her husband dress and get to the breakfast table,
but she can’t lift him into the car. 
An adult child may be able to attend to his disabled father regularly and arrange for visiting nurses, but he can’t take on the responsibilities of his father moving in with the family."
25,17,How to evaluate the situation of stroke,"This evaluation is probably best made by someone else perhaps a professional who is both knowledgeable and more objective. But if you have always been the independent type, then you will probably be making your own assessment. Again, I advise you that your stroke may have left you with some limitations in your self-awareness. You benefit from involving your caregiver and other family members, perhaps even friends, your doctor, and the other health professionals who are aware of your situation."
26,17,What are some tips for the caregivers,"Change for the better often starts when things seem the worst. Insist on staying healthy, both mentally and physically. Insist on getting help. And take the
following advice:
 Set limits and be sure and take time off.
 Take things a day at a time.
 Get some sleep.
 Keep a list of things you need done, and when others offer help, give
them something on the list.
 Maintain a support system of friends and family.
 Mind your health and finances.
 You’re not perfect — just do your best.
 Join a support group"
27,17,What is the overview of stroke finance ,"If you were the breadwinner of the family or your income was critical to your family’s budget you may be worried about finances along with everything else. 
If you can’t work, how are you going to pay the mortgage? 
Even if you plan to return to work eventually, how will your family adjust to the reduced income in the meantime? And how will you handle all the medical expenses piling up from your hospitalization?
You may be lucky you may have a great insurance plan that will pay for all or most of your care. 
You may not be the primary breadwinner in your family after all. 
Or, best of all, your disability may be so neglible you anticipate returning to work without missing a beat.
But if you’re like most stroke survivors, you’ll experience at least some financial impact from your stroke. 
Now, I don’t claim to be a financial expert I’m a doctor, after all but I do know that the processes of collecting insurance, dealing with employers, and settling the accounts of someone with a major disabling illness is profoundly complicated."
28,17,What is the advice for stroke family that is drowning in financial workloads,"Your family may have to turn to a professional to help you sort out all your
options. I know, I know . . . you’re concerned about your limited resources,
and I’m suggesting that you pay someone to help you? Trust me, if your
family feels as if they’re drowning in financial paperwork and can’t make
sense of the various resources, your investment will garner a great return.
Here are some materials your financial advisor may request in order to help
you make some decisions:
 All recent bills, paid and unpaid
 Insurance policies
 Social Security information
 Recent income tax returns
 Paychecks/stubs
 Investment documents
 Bank account information
 Loan statements
 Mortgages and deeds"
29,17,What is the best legacy of stroke for the kids,"You have wills and powers of attorney to take care of your legal and financial legacy. 
The only way you have to protect your genetic legacy is
to educate the rest of your family on what they
can do to avoid or postpone having a stroke or
heart disease themselves. Do your kids smoke?
Have they checked their blood pressure? Do
they get exercise and watch their blood lipid
levels? Good health could be the most valuable
part of your estate. Maybe they didn’t listen to
you when they were teenagers. Maybe your
recent stroke experience and a few years of
maturity have made them better listeners."
30,17,What are the power and effects of family,"Here are some family strengths:
A family increases the effectiveness of problem-solving and results in a
better solution for everyone.
 A family provides emotional support for each other and, as a result, the
group together is happier, more productive, and has more stamina than
they would were they separate.
 A family can set priorities and establish reasonable standards and allow
its members to feel they are doing their parts. Unreasonable expectations and criticisms can be brought out into the open and dealt with
Directly."
31,18,What are some organizations that I can contact with,"Several organizations at the national level offer services and resources that reach down to local communities, though the availability varies by state and city. The American Stroke Association and the National Stroke Association are two voluntary organizations at the national level. You can join each of these organizations and participate in national programs to increase stroke education, promote research, and help stroke survivors and caretakers alike.
The groups sponsor research and publish helpful information. Both provide extensive information for patients and professionals. You do not have to be a member to benefit from the information on their Web sites.
American Stroke Association (www.strokeassociation.org) — closely affiliated with the American Heart Association
National Stroke Association (www.stroke.org)
Some government organizations that offer valuable resources are
National Institutes of Health (www.nih.gov)
Centers for Disease Control (www.cdc.gov) 
National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (www.ninds. nih.gov)
An unusual regional organization, the Stroke Belt Consortium, exists in the southeastern United States to address the needs of this high-risk area for stroke. 
You will certainly find the information on its Web site, www.strokebelt.org, helpful."
32,18,What is the simplest way to help the community to manage stroke,"Share Knowledge with Friends and Family
The only thing many of your friends and family may know about stroke is that they don’t want one. You can teach them to recognize signs and symptoms of stroke and better yet help them prevent stroke. 
Through your experiences, you may persuade them to take steps to reduce their own stroke risk
and learn what steps to take if someone they love is suddenly stricken with a stroke.
Think about it: As a stroke survivor, you have gained an advanced education in stroke and its prevention and care. 
Why not put your hard-earned knowledge to good use and teach others? From “Emergency Room 101” to graduate
classes in blood pressure and cholesterol care, you have a lot to offer your friends and family.
Simply telling the story of your stroke and how it has affected you can have a profound impact. Your friends and colleagues may not pick up on the scary public service announcements in newspapers or TV but I’ll bet the story you share with them will stick and be forwarded to people they know. You can also encourage them to be aware of the need for good stroke care in your community and the importance of building community resources. 
Your efforts may even persuade them to volunteer to help families struggling with stroke"

34,19,What are advice for stroke recovery,"Everyone who survives stroke holds within them a remarkable tale. Your life
may not have been one of fame or celebrity, but the struggle you’ve been
engaged in is no less significant than the ones mentioned here.
Take the time to consider your own experiences and write your own story.
Reflect on your accomplishments — even the simplest steps forward. I’ll bet
when you do, you’ll discover that you, too, have an inspiring story to tell."
35,19,Are there any stroke Miss America that can recovery,"Who could have imagined that the 20-year-old college student who won the
Miss America pageant in 1963 would be struck down at the age of 28 — with a
massive stroke? In 1970, the young mother woke one morning to discover she
couldn’t move or speak. Jackie Mayer survived the near-fatal experience, and
began a long, arduous seven-year journey that required relearning how to
speak, walk, and even tie her shoes. Her rehabilitation was intense and even
when she regained the ability to overcome almost all of her disability, her
public appearances required an athletic endurance and a high level of selfdiscipline.
As she recovered, she turned outward and became a national spokesperson for
the National Stroke Association. She shot a video, A Different Kind of Beauty, to
increase stroke awareness, for the American Heart Association. Mayer wrote a
regular column for the National Stroke Association’s Be Stroke Smart publication. She served on the National Advisory Council of the National Institute of
Neurological Disorders and Stroke in Washington and has received awards for
her work in stroke. She still works as a motivational speaker. "
36,19,What is the drug of choice after stroke,TPA
37,19,Who is the first person found TPA is effective for after stroke,Writer Ken Kesey
38,19,How human can found the drug of choice after stroke,"American novelist Ken Elton Kesey became as well known for his Acid Test parties and Merry Pranksters cross-country antics as he was for his books
One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest and Sometimes a Great Notion. At the height
of his popularity, Kesey, born in 1935, bridged the gap between the 1950s
Beat Generation and the 1960s hippie culture of California. Yet when Kesey
suffered a stroke at 62, TPA not LSD was the drug that saved him.
In 1997, Kesey had a stroke and was treated with TPA which had only been
approved a year earlier. He responded to treatment and regained the use of
his right arm, which had been paralyzed by the stroke. The stroke research
Community still remembers his much-publicized description of TPA as Drano
for the Brain-o.
Thanks, most likely, to TPA, his disability from stroke was minimal. In fact,
rather than slowing him down, the stroke inspired him with new energy that
lead to a final burst of creativity, including a bus tour of the United Kingdom
with some 30 passengers, performing a traveling version of his play Where’s
Merlin? before he died of cancer in 2001"
39,19,Who is the actress recover stroke,Patricia Neal
40,19,How Patricia Neal recover stroke,"A year after winning an Academy Award for her role in the movie Hud, actress Patricia Neal experienced a stroke so devastating that it put her in a coma that lasted 21 days. Actually, she had three strokes in a single day. 
She was pregnant at the time. Miraculously, she survived, gave birth to a daughter six months later, and went on to star in movies — and even received another
Oscar nomination. Hers is one of the better known stories of remarkable recovery and return to a full life after stroke.
Neal was 39 in 1966, when she developed a terrible headache followed by disorientation and vomiting. 
She had a stroke that sent her to the emergency room, where she had another and finally a third one that same day. 
These strokes were caused by subarachnoid hemorrhage. After surgery to clip the burst aneurysm, she fell into a coma. She wasn’t expected to survive.
Three weeks later, she came out of the coma, paralyzed on her right side, unable to speak or understand conversation, and with double vision. 
She had to relearn to speak and walk. Her husband, writer Roald Dahl, worked closely with her to develop a rehabilitation program that kept her occupied every minute of every day. 
This helped her to direct her anger and frustration into the drive and determination to make her mind and body do the work necessary for recovery.
She gave birth to a daughter six months after her stroke. Her recovery continued during this time. She battled depression and setbacks, but persevered and gradually began to appear in public once again. In 1968, she starred in the movie The Subject Was Roses and was nominated for an Academy Award.
Neal has appeared in many movies and television performances. 
She has also been an active spokesperson for stroke in 1978, she helped to dedicate the Patricia Neal Rehabilitation Center, in her hometown of Knoxville, Tennessee."
41,20,What are opportunities to prevent stroke,"Gathering Information
Treating High Blood Pressure
Preventing Blood Clot Formation
Reducing Cholesterol in Your Blood
Treating Atrial Fibrillation
Checking Out Your Carotid Arteries
Eating Right and Staying Hydrated
Stopping Smoking
Exercising Your Muscles and Your Brain
Writing Up a Maintenance Plan"
42,20,What are information that we should gathering for stroke prevention,"At the minimum, a recent accurate measurement of the following should be available to you if you are going to take maximum advantage of the opportunities available to you (also see the Cheat Sheet at the front of this book for a handy list you can take with you).
Weight
Height
Abdominal girth (waist measurement)
Blood pressure
HDL and LDL cholesterol levels after eight hours of fasting
Glucose tolerance test
Electrocardiogram
Chest X-ray
Carotid ultrasound
Hemoglobin and hematocrit
Cardiac stress test"
43,20,How to preventing blood clot formation,"Numerous trials among sufferers of white stroke have shown that medication helps reduce the likelihood that more blood clots will form inside your heart and the arteries of the brain.
Aspirin is the most commonly recommended drug. Aspirin is inexpensive and generally well-tolerated in the low doses now generally recommended, either one regular (325 milligrams) or one small tablet (100 or 81 milligrams) every day. 
Side effects include easy bruising and stomach pain with bleeding ulcers.
You may not tolerate aspirin — or your doctor may recommend a medication found to be more effective than aspirin. Two common alternatives are clopidogrel, known by the trade name Plavix, and Aggrenox, a combination of a very small dose of aspirin with a drug called dypyridamole. Warfarin may be another medication suggested by your doctor for preventing blood clots particularly if you have atrial fibrillation or a heart valve. 
But warfarin is not only more expensive, it entails some risks that require frequent blood testing.
Bottom line: It’s important to take the necessary steps to prevent blood clotting if you’re at risk for stroke. Medication is critical in helping with this
effort. 
Whether your doctor recommends a low dose of aspirin or one of the other medications, be sure you understand the precautions and follow the dosage guidelines as given."
44,20,How to reducing cholesterol in my blood,"Evidence supports this: People who exercise regularly and follow certain diets have healthier levels of cholesterol in their blood. 
Diet and exercise may reduce the “bad” cholesterol and increase the “good” .New information is beginning to focus on the especially harmful effects of trans fats processed foods such as solid margarine that have been hydrogenated for longer shelf life.
Repeated testing of your blood cholesterol levels should be done to determine if you are taking the correct dose for you."
45,20,Why we should eating right and staying hydrated,"Ensuring that you are fueling yourself with a healthy diet and taking in plenty
of fluids can have a direct impact on your risk of stroke. 
A diet high in certain kinds of fats (hydrogenated oils, high-fat
dairy products, and, yes, those thick slabs of steak you adore) can lead to
unhealthy cholesterol levels which means greater risk of heart attack and
Stroke."
46,20,Does smoking cause stroke,"What more can I say about tobacco use? If you always thought lung cancer
was your greatest risk from smoking, I hope you now know that far more
cases of emphysema, heart attack, and stroke result from smoking. Indeed,
one of the most dramatic changes you can make to improve your health is to
toss the cigarettes.
You’ll save money. Your clothes will smell better. Your lungs will be clearer.
You’ll reduce your stroke risk. Quit today"
47,20,What are tips for exerces,"Exercise is hard to overdo, but it is possible. A regimen that’s too difficult is not likely to last. If you hate to exercise and have started and failed before, I suggest trying walking. If you stay out of the way of cars, it is generally safe and results in fewer injuries than running.
A weight-training program managed by a physical therapist or experienced trainer can also be very helpful."

X-rays are taken from many different angles as the emitter orbits around your head. In about five minutes, the scan process is completed. A computer constructs an image of the brain inside the skull by adding together all the information."
71,2,Could you tell me what is MRI?,"The magnetic resonance imaging, or MRI, scan can look a lot like the CT scan, but it uses magnetism and radio waves instead of X-rays to form images."
72,2,What are the benefits of an MRI scan over a CT scan,"The result is a much more detailed picture of the brain than a CT scan provides. However, An MRI scan takes longer to perform and requires the patient to hold still in a very confined space."
73,2,Can you tell me about PET scan?,"A positron emission tomography, or PET, scan can actually show the chemical activity of the brain via the introduction of special radioactive compounds into the brain. The result is in color, but are not as detailed as CT and MRI scans. For the present time, PET scans are for research purpose."

75,3,What are the risk factors of white stroke?,"High blood pressure.
Fat and atherosclerosis
Smoking tobacco.
Atrial fibrillation.
Estrogen: Pregnancy, the pill, and
Hormone-replacement supplements and other risks are risk factor of white stroke"
76,3,"I don't know Estrogen, what is it?",Estrogen is a hormone that occurs naturally in women
77,3,Why does Estrogen lead to white stroke?,"Estrogen levels are especially high in pregnancy, when it is a good idea to be able to clot and prevent excessive bleeding. Many women also take estrogen orally in birth control pills or in hormone-replacement supplements during menopause. However, this is increase the occurrence of blood clots."
78,3,How White Stroke Injures the Brain,"White ischemic stroke is caused by a blood clot blocking an artery to the brain. Either the flow is completely or partially cut off to some portion of the brain that depends primarily on that artery for blood. As time passes, brain cells in the affected region stop their usual function as they run out of oxygen. After a short time, if blood flow is not restored, the brain cells are not able to keep up with their basic needs for survival. When this happens, the cells begin to die, and their cell walls begin to break down. For a while, the brain can hold its breath. Some cells in the brain can survive longer without oxygen than others. Some can steal enough oxygen from nearby blood vessels that are still flowing to keep themselves alive. However, others start dying within minutes of the first deprivation of blood. Most of the cells die within three to four hours."
79,3,What are the different sizes of white strokes,"Big strokes: Blocking a major artery
Medium stroke: Blocking branches of main trunk arteries
Small strokes: Cross circulation minimizes injury"
80,3,Could you tell me what are diagnostic methods for white stroke?,"There are many diagnostic methods for white stroke such as CT and MRI scan, Ultrasound, Angiograms and other tests"
81,3,What white stroke treatments are there?,Dissolving the clot is the most likely method of treating white strokes at the moment.
82,3,What is FDA treatment?,"FDA treatment is TPA (tissue plasminogen activator), a drug that dissolves the blood clot that is blocking a brain artery and causing ischemia in part of the brain."
83,4,What is transient stroke?,It is called TIA. This is type of stoke that take place in a short time.
84,4,How to Recognize a Transient Stroke,"If you have a little spell that starts out like a stroke but clears up, it could be a transient stroke.
For instance, Arm or leg falls asleep, Dizzy spell, Migraine headaches, Seizure, Diabetes."
85,1,What are symp of stroke?,"Most strokes are painless, and the symptoms."
86,1,How does stroke occurs?,A brain attack strikes its victims quickly and powerfully and without warning.
87,1,What are risk factors of stroke?,"High blood pressure,
High cholesterol,
Obesity, and diabetes possibly serving as warning signs that the brain is in danger."
88,1,Why does stroke occurs?,"The glucose and oxygen transported by one of the brain’s arteries are not reaching some part of the brain, which in less than a minute will begin to shut down. And you will show signs of stroke"
89,1,"Could you tell me, what are signs of stroke?","The 50 professional groups forming the Brain Attack Coalition describe the signs of stroke as follows
Sudden numbness or weakness of face, arm, or leg, especially on one
side of the body;
Sudden confusion, trouble speaking or understanding speech;
Sudden trouble seeing in one or both eyes;
Sudden trouble walking, dizziness, loss of balance or coordination;
Sudden severe headache with no known cause;"
90,1,why is it that a blocked artery in brain causes I to lose control,"Suppose a small blood clot forms in your heart and flows with the blood up into your brain and plugs an artery that feeds a part of your brain near the top of your head. Normally, that part of the brain sends nerve impulses down threadlike fibers through the base of your brain and along your spinal cord down to a point a couple of inches below your lowest rib. There those nerve fibers connect to other nerve fibers that extend down to muscles in your legs. But without blood flow, the affected part of the brain stops sending messages. when you lose control."
91,1,Why does a stroke last for a few minutes can lead to a major injury?,Most other cells in the body can survive for up to an hour without blood flow. The brain cells stop working in a matter of seconds and start dying after five minutes
92,1,How to recognize Stroke?,"Sometimes, with severe headache, for example, it’s hard to tell whether a stroke is happening at all because the symptoms are similar to those of a migraine headache. A stroke might cause dizziness that is difficult to distinguish from an inner-ear infection."
93,1,how should i classify stroke?,"Some strokes are caused by broken blood vessels which results in blood in the brain or brain area (thus, the red);
other strokes are caused by the blockage of vessels to the brain, so no blood gets there (hence, white)."
94,1,Why do white stroke call white?,"If the clot blocks blood to a part of your brain, you have a stroke. If the clot stays in place for even a short time, part of your brain dies, leaving a hole called a brain infarction. The affected area of brain turns from pink to white because there is no red blood flowing (another good reason to refer to this type of stroke as white)."
95,1,What is brain infarction?,"Sometimes it's called white stroke. Because, If the clot blocks blood to a part of your brain, you have a stroke. If the clot stays in place for even a short time, part of your brain dies, leaving a hole called a brain infarction."
96,1,When red and white stroke occur together,White ischemic strokes can turn red if a blood vessel is injured and breaks in the area where lack of blood flow caused a brain infarction. The bleeding can become a major intracranial hemorrhage or it may just be a small leak that doesn’t do much more damage than has already been done by the ischemia.
97,5,What do brain hemorrhages causes?,High blood pressure particularly longstanding high blood pressure is the leading cause of brain hemorrhages.
98,5,When does a white stroke change to a red stroke?,White ischemic strokes can turn red if a blood vessel is injured and breaks in the area where lack of blood flow caused a brain infarction. The bleeding can become a major intracranial hemorrhage or it may just be a small leak that doesn’t do much more damage than has already been done by the ischemia.
99,5,What is AVMs?,"One of the most common blood-vessel abnormalities, arteriovenous malformations or AVMs, are formed from brain arteries and veins. Brain bleeding from AVMs is generally not as severe as the more common type of brain hemorrhage from a broken artery."
100,10,what is the  related between stroke and another diseases ?,"Many of the risks for stroke are linked together one condition aggravates or causes another, like dominoes in your vascular system
High blood pressure puts more wear and tear on blood vessels and seems to worsen atherosclerosis, probably because the plaque formation has something to do with the healing process that occurs when the lining of an artery is injured
Atherosclerosis is further aggravated by diabetes
High blood glucose levels seem to lead to injuries in the blood vessels
Diabetes also injures the heart muscles, resulting in more sources of clots to break loose and injure the brain."
101,10,could you tell me about risk factors of stroke ?,"Family history
Age
Gender
Race
Previous stroke
Hypertension
High blood lipids and cholesterol
Heart and vascular disease
Smoking tobacco
Diabetes
Obesity
Oral contraceptives and estrogen replacement
Drug and alcohol abuse"
102,10,how can I classify risk factors of stroke ?,"Some risks factors you can’t control
Other risks are treatable or preventable."
103,10,could you help me define what is the hypertension ?,"High blood pressure, the most important factor determining the likelihood that you will have a stroke"
104,10,what is overvier of smoking tobacco in real world ?,"Smoking is the biggest preventable cause of death in the United States
In the U.S., roughly 440,000 people die each year from smoking-related illnesses
Treating the effects of smoking puts a chokehold on our nation’s health costs we’re talking in the range of $70 billion per year
And yet each day nearly 4,000 young people under the age of 18 light up for the first time, according to some esti- mates."
105,10,what is the  related between stroke and blood diseases ?,"These substances cause blood vessels to constrict (there goes your blood pressure!), 
reduce oxygen (forcing the heart to work harder), scrape the inside of the blood vessels (forming plaques), and make blood “stickier” 
(leading to more vessel damage and paving the way for atherosclerosis and clots)."
106,10,what is the risk of smoker having stroke ?,"The risk of having a stroke is about 30 percent
more than a nonsmoker who doesn’t inhale someone else’s smoke."
107,10,how can I plan of action to stop smoking ?,"The plan of action to reduce stroke risk caused by smoking is: Stop! There are programs to help you stop smoking
There are approved drugs to help you get over your dependence on nicotine
If you smoke, then chances are very good that you’ve tried to stop
The pain of stopping is immediate and the benefits seem a little vague when you are in withdrawal
You need to find what is motivating you to smoke and tackle that."
108,10,what kind of approaches to stopping smoking ?,"There are quite a few approaches to stopping smoking, including structured programs that offer various tools for quitting, 
including medication, psycho logical support, group support, and behavior-modification techniques."
109,10,what is benefits if I stop smoking ?,"The benefits of breathing better, not coughing as much, and not getting as many infections are always immediate and increase your health and well-being."
110,10,what is related between stroke and heart vascular diseases ?,"Several heart diseases are connected to stroke because heart disease produces conditions that increase blood clotting, which results in stroke.
Treatment almost always includes some medication to slow blood clotting."
111,10,what is the risk for stroke if I have mechanical value ?,"If you have a mechanical (artificial) valve, your risk for stroke is significantly increased
If you do have a stroke, it is critical to communicate and coordinate your care between your heart specialist (cardiologist) and your stroke specialist
First, because you are undoubtedly on an anticlotting medication possibly warfarin
But it may be at a different dosage than required for your stroke condition
Your clotting control will have to be reevaluated after the stroke, and your medication may need adjustment
Additionally, the valve itself must be checked."
112,10,what is drugs to preventing blood clot ?,"Aspirin
Warfarin"
113,10,what is disease if I have several symptoms such as bleeding in the stomach or intestines ?,"If your blood is too thin and doesn’t clot well, you could be at high risk for brain bleeding — red stroke."
114,10,what is advantages and disadvantages of warfarin ?,"Warfarin, also known as Coumadin, prevents clots by depriving the body of vitamin K, a substance in green leafy vegetables that helps blood clot.
But taking too much warfarin can cause widespread severe bleeding. 
It is critical to monitor the dosage of warfarin carefully in order not to shift the balance from preventing the risk of white stroke to increasing the risk of red stroke."
115,10,how blood test is measured and what is it meaning ?,"The blood test that measures the time it takes for your blood to clot is called the prothrombin time or protime (PT)
PT is the key to fitting your dose of warfarin to your needs
The results of the PT test are given as a ratio, which can be thought of as the relative time it takes the blood to clot
The technical term for the ratio is the International Normalized Ratio (INR)
If the INR is three, then it takes, roughly, three times as long as normal for your blood to clot
If the INR is 1.5, then bleeding from a cut that normally would stop on its own in five minutes would take 7 or 8 minutes to stop."
116,10,what should I do if I was diagnosis have a stroke ?,"You should be proactive in supporting a positive treatment experience
Here are some steps you can take to help your doctor achieve the optimal prescription for you: 
Take your medicine the same time every day and eat similar meals to the extent possible
The best time to take warfarin is before dinner
Consider how often and how consistently you eat leafy green vegetables
They are good for you, but they provide a lot of vitamin K, which counter- acts the effect of warfarin
Eating a lot of leafy greens one day, then none for the next few days can make it hard to get consistent INR readings
Adhere to your dosage instructions
The usual dose of warfarin is between 2 and 5 milligrams once per day
Making a commitment to taking the drug requires diligence on your part
If you forget to take your meds or the right dosage, then warfarin is not for you
Better to take aspirin, which doesn’t need to be monitored so carefully
Watch for signs of bleeding (check your gums after brushing your teeth) and bruising
Be sure to make your appointments for checking the PT time to keep your blood from getting “too thin.” If you need a dosage adjustment, better to make it sooner rather than later."
117,10,could you tell me about heart failure ?,"Every time a healthy heart beats, it squeezes out about 55 percent of the blood in the largest chamber of the heart (the left ventri- cle)
If you have heart failure, your heart only manages to get out 40 percent or less
When this happens, fluid can build up around the ankles and in the lungs, making it more difficult for you to walk and to breathe
Other symptoms you might have are coughing, waking up at night short of breath, and chronic fatigue."
118,10,what is the diabetes ?,"In a nutshell, diabetes is a condition in which the body does not produce or use insulin properly. "
119,10,what does diabetes have to do with stroke ?,"Diabetes makes blood vessels more prone to injury
It is as if diabetic arteries do not endure the wear and tear of life as well as nondiabetic arteries
The effects of major risk factors for stroke atherosclerosis and high blood pressure are increased in diabetics"
120,10,how to calculate the amount of weight I gain ?,The amount of weight you gain is equal to the difference between the amount of energy you consume and the amount of energy you expend.
121,10,how should I do to lose my weight ?,"You lose weight by a combination of two strategies: First, you exercise more to build muscle mass and burn energy from fat reserves
The greater muscle mass is always burning glucose, even when you are resting
Just like your brain
Second, you consume less energy
Energy is measured in calories
Calories come from food"
122,10,how can I diagnosis whether or not I have had a stroke ?,"Blood-pressure tracking
EKG reading
Cholesterol level
Diabetes testing
Other tests
Ultrasound for atherosclerosis
Chest X-ray
CT or MRI scan"
123,10,could you tell me about diagnosis methods for stroke ?,"Blood-pressure tracking
EKG reading
Cholesterol level
Diabetes testing
Other tests
Ultrasound for atherosclerosis
Chest X-ray
CT or MRI scan"
124,11,what does a stroke feel like ?,"The word stroke means a sudden or swift action  a golf stroke, a stroke of luck, the stroke of a pen
Stroke, the disease, is also sudden and requires a swift response
When you have a stroke, you suffer a sudden loss of part of your brain function
You’re normal one moment and suddenly very different only a minute or two later
Usually there is no pain associated with a stroke
Now, that’s not true 100 percent of the time
Sharp neck pain or very severe headache may be present with a few strokes
But specific symptoms indicate that something is sud- denly and clearly amiss with the brain
The key concepts bound together by the word stroke are"
125,11,what if I am incapacitated ?,"If you experience loss of feeling or paralysis or cannot speak or find yourself in a state of confusion, you may not be able to seek help. 
You may have to rely on family members, friends, or even strangers to call for emergency help."
126,11,what to do if someone is having a stroke ?,"When someone is having a stroke, you will notice some peculiar behavior immediately: The mouth may droop on one side of the face, as if the face is slack on that side. 
This droop is often accompanied by slurred speech. 
Talking becomes a struggle — often the sufferer can only get out a word or two and then becomes mute."
127,11,what happens to my heart/brain/blood after a stroke  ?,"With stroke, the heart is not affected and continues beating. Partial blood flow continues, and the brain can survive longer — but every minute still counts."
128,11,what level of emergency for stroke ?,"Stroke is a major emergency. 
It’s the brain! 
Because the stroke patient may not be in a position to speak up, it may be up to the family member or friend to make sure the individual is given the attention he or she needs."
129,11,what is the “golder hour” of stroke victim ?,"For the stroke victim, the race against time continues in the emergency department
The next hour is called the “golden hour” because during that time the opportunity is greatest to prevent or limit permanent damage
Don’t expect the doctors to stop and spend 20 minutes talking to the family
This is not the time
Brain is dying and the stroke response team must focus every minute on determining the cause of the stroke to treat as quickly as possible."
130,11,how many main types of stroke ?,"Acute ischemic stroke
Transient ischemic stroke
Intracerebral hemorrhage
Subarachnoid hemorrhage"
131,11,how many types of white stroke and treating it ?,"There are two types of white strokes (the blood-clotting kind): the acute ischemic stroke and the transient ischemic stroke.
With the first kind, the doctors want to re-open the plugged vessel by dissolving the blood clot and restoring blood flow quickly before the brain is permanently injured."
132,11,how can the doctor treats white strokes ?,"The treatment that does that job is tissue plasminogen activator, better known as TPA the only FDA-approved treatment for white strokes."
133,11,who can benefit from TPA to treat white stroke ?,"The stroke causes significant disability and is not considered a minor stroke
The stroke is not rapidly improving
The symptoms of stroke should not be suggestive of bleeding from a ruptured aneurysm (SAH stroke)
The stroke onset is less than three hours before beginning treatment
No major head injury or prior stroke in previous three months
No heart attack in previous three months
No bleeding from the stomach, bowels, kidneys, or bladder in the previ- ous 21 days
No major surgery in previous 14 days
No history of previous intracranial hemorrhage
Blood pressure not elevated (systolic should be less than 185, diastolic less than 110)
No evidence of active bleeding or recent injury causing a fracture
The blood should clot normally
Blood glucose concentration must not be excessively elevated."
134,11,what severe of red strokes ?,Severe of red stroke stops the patient from breathing and requires that tough decisions be made.
135,11,How should the doctor do for treating red stroke ?,"The goal of treatment is to stop the bleeding as soon as possible. 
Unfortunately, very little can be done other than lowering excessively high blood pressure, which has to be performed very carefully. 
Actions can be taken to help reduce brain swelling if that is a problem. 
A neurosurgeon may be called to evaluate the patient. 
Sometimes the blood inside the brain can be removed, and the patient does well, but the general rule is that surgery doesn’t make that much difference. 
You have to trust the surgeon’s judgment on this tough decision."
136,12,how could I do  for reducing the risk of another white stroke ?,"Four critical steps can help prevent a second white stroke:
Take a drug to slow down your blood clotting.
Have carotid endarterectomy to check for blockage.
Learn the signs and symptoms of stroke so you can get to the emergency department faster in the future.
Control your high blood pressure better, get your cholesterol down, stop smoking, and control diabetes."
137,12,why I need to check my heart when I have a white stroke ?,"If you’ve had a white (ischemic) stroke (or a red intracerebral stroke, for that matter), you don’t just have high risk of another stroke. 
You also have high risk of heart disease. 
An exam by a cardiologist during your hospital stay is critical in determining the status of your heart and blood vessels. 
An electrocardiogram (EKG) is an easy and virtually pain-free test. 
The suction cups some doctors still use on your chest wall may leave bruises, but besides that, the test is just another small event in the complex day of the recovering stroke patient."
138,12,what are prevention high blood presure ?,"High blood pressure is the most common cause of intracerebral (ICH) red strokes those that bleed within the brain. 
If you are over 50 or 55 and have high blood pressure, the cause of your stroke is usually just that. 
If you are especially young and do not have high blood pressure or another reason that explains your red stroke, then further tests may be conducted.
A cerebral angiogram is a likely procedure to be scheduled. 
MRI scans might pick up the presence of arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) and some other abnormali- ties of blood vessels."
139,12,how to avoiding further red strokes ?,"You prevent the recurrence of bleeding from brain aneurysms by either clip- ping them off from outside through the skull (a big deal) or by coiling them off from the inside (still a big deal, but perhaps a little safer). 
Before such surgery, doctors are likely to run a series of MRI studies and an angiogram to accurately locate the aneurysm. 
Sometimes it’s hard to tell which aneurysm actually did the bleeding when two or more are found."
140,12,what is brain swelling ?,"Brain swelling is a very serious complication of stroke and can occur for a number of reasons. 
If you have a white stroke, the brain area injured by a lack of blood will begin to swell. 
In red stroke, the brain swells because of the extra blood from the bleeding. 
In addition, the blood can block the flow of fluid in the ventricles and the backed-up fluid expands the brain. 
Finally, any blood inside the substance of the brain causes inflammation and swelling."
141,12,what is the antiseizure medications ?,"Several medications are available, including ophenytoin (Dilantin) and carbamazepine (Tegretol). 
"
142,12,how risk leg clots are ?,"The blood in your leg veins is moved along slowly toward the heart in part by the gentle squeezing whenever you contract the leg muscles. 
The veins have tough but thin walls that are easily squeezed by muscles. 
They are likewise easily distended by blood seeping into them from the tiny capillaries that connect to arteries."
143,12,what happened when the clots hit the lungs ?,"If the clot is small enough to pass through the right side of the heart without causing damage, its next stop, as it transfers to the outgoing transportation system the arteries is the lungs. 
Small clots block only small bits of lung, and blood flows through alternate pathways."
144,12,how should I do for preventing blood clots in the legs ?,"Obviously, the best thing to do is to keep the clots from forming in the veins in the first place. 
Shifting your position stirs the blood and moves it toward the heart, keeping it from forming blood clots."
145,12,what do I need in hospital after stroke ?,"The hospital staff is there to help you plan for after you leave the hospital. 
They have a lot of experience with stroke patients welcome their input and seek out their advice and knowledge. 
Cooperate with the hospital therapists to develop a post-hospital plan and learn as much as you can about becoming as independent as possible. 
You and your care- taker can start practicing some of what you learn whether it’s tips for getting out of bed into a chair or strategies for bathing. 
"
146,13,how is the life in rehabilitation center ?,"The term rehab may conjure up images of celebrities escaping to luxurious private facilities where they lounge around landscaped grounds, wear designer robes, and dine on gourmet fare prepared by famous chefs. 
In truth, a rehabilitation center is not a place where the stroke survivor is pampered and waited on hand and foot. Instead of spa resort, think back-to-school. 
Yes, the rehabilitation center is more of an educational institution offering a crash course in skills that will help the stroke victim regain independence and lead a fuller life."
147,13,who should gop to rehab ?,"The answer depends on many different factors: doctor recommendation, severity of stroke and the damage incurred, level of care that can be provided in the home, and, no less important, the attitude and openness of the stroke patient and the family toward the rehab experience."
148,13,how much rehabilitation is needed ?,"Most stroke patients who go into a rehab center stay for weeks not months. 
Though many have told me later that they wished they could have stayed longer. 
But each stroke patient is unique and, consequently, will follow different programs with different time requirements."
149,13,why can’t I have rehab in my own home ?,"Of course, with unlimited resources, you can turn your home into a rehabilitation center and have the appropriate specialists come to you. 
However, this turns out to be very difficult. 
Scheduling difficulties, space limitations, and lack of equipment may be a few challenges. 
Even more critical, you’d miss out on the interaction with other patients and families in the same predicament."
150,5,Could you tell me about red stroke,"red strokes are caused by bleeding of the brain arteries
The two types of red stroke are differentiated by
where the bleeding starts. One type involves bleeding in the areas surrounding the brain, called subarachnoid hemorrhage or aneurysm"
151,5,what are symtoms that  are caused by Brain hemorrhage,"symptoms as a white stroke. This includes
paralysis of the face, arm, or leg on one side of the body, difficulty speaking
or understanding speech, loss of sensation on part of one side of the body,
dizziness, and clumsiness in the use of the arms or legs"
152,5,What is the severity of cerebral hemorrhage,"Brain hemorrhages are more often fatal and cause more severe disability than
the more common white ischemic stroke. The chances of someone dying in
the first few days after a brain hemorrhage (ICH) are about 40 percent —
double the rate for white strokes, which is about 20 percent"
153,5,what age is most susceptible to brain hemorrhage,"Victims of brain hemorrhage are typically between 55 and 60 years old —
younger than those who suffer from white strokes"
154,5,What percentage is the number of people with cerebral hemorrhage," brain hemorrhage is a less common type of stroke, striking approximately 15 percent of all stroke sufferers. This equates to an estimated 70,000 individuals
each year in the United States"
155,5,Can you tell me about the reason for the brain Bleeding,"High blood pressure — particularly longstanding high blood pressure — is
the leading cause of brain hemorrhages, being responsible for nearly half.
Still, that leaves many other possible causes.brain hemorrhage may be the result of anything from abnormal blood
vessels to a bladder infection"
156,5,When white stroke leads to red stroke,"What starts out as a white stroke caused by a blood clot blocking an artery
can turn into a red stroke with bleeding into the brain"
157,5,What medications are used to dissolve blood clots,"Heparin
is mostly used in the hospital since it must be dripped into a vein. Warfarin
(also called Coumadin) is taken when you are not in the hospital"
158,5,Could you tell me Who is at risk for a brain hemorrhage,"brain hemorrhage claims a lot more causes than white stroke
does. Here are several others that doctors may test for
+Aging of blood vessels
+Cocaine and stimulant drugs
+Blood-clotting deficiencies
+Extremely high blood pressure
+Red strokes due to subarachnoid bleeding
+Head trauma"
159,5,"Can you tell me about treating brain hemorrhage
in the hospital
","Treating bleeding inside the brain is difficult. The bleeding is tightly enclosed
in the skull where broken blood vessels can’t easily be reached. Even if a surgeon cuts through the skull, the source of the bleeding is usually farther
inside the brain itself. Eventually the bleeding stops on its own — by clot formation and increasing pressure inside the skull. But doctors must deal with
the effects of the bleeding, including brain swelling and unconsciousness and
other conditions that may slow the clotting process"
160,5,How to treat the brain hemorrhage that was caused by an infection in the bloodstream,"If a brain hemorrhage was caused by an infection in the bloodstream, then it
is likely that massive amounts of antibiotics will be administered along with
treatments for brain swelling and unconsciousness. If the brain recovers well,
the treatment of the blood infection can takes weeks or even months to complete. If a heart valve or implanted device becomes infected, surgery may be
required, though it usually can be postponed until after stroke recovery"
161,5,How to prevent the red stroke,"Someone lucky enough to get out of the hospital after a brain hemorrhage
needs to take action to prevent more strokes. A red stroke puts you at
increased risk of white strokes. Here are some preventative measures
+Treat your blood pressure
+Monitor your warfarin
+Manage blood lipids, diabetes, and heart disease:"
162,6,what is the SAH stroke,"SAH stroke is subarachnoid hemorrhage
this form of red stroke — involving bleeding outside the
brain — is the least common of the four major types of stroke, afflicting just
3 percent of all stroke sufferers
SAH strokes are most common in adults between 55 and 60 — a bit
younger than the average stroke victim"
163,6,How SAH Strokes Happen,SHA stroke happen when  aneurysm in the brain
164,6,what is the warning signs from enlarging aneurysms,"Evidence indicates that aneurysms start out small and enlarge over time.
Depending on where they are, aneurysms may reveal their presence — before
they burst — through a variety of warning signs
+Face and eye pain
+Large pupil in one eye
+Headaches
+Neck pain and stiffness that come on suddenly
+Sudden pain between the shoulder blades"
165,6,When brain aneurysms rupture,"we have our well-packaged brain floating in a layer of protective fluid, and
within that shock-absorbing padding, we have arteries threading in from the
base of the skull and into the brain. Arteries sometimes develop aneurysms —
those stretched-out sections — from weak spots. These spots sometimes leak
and seal themselves off, causing uncomfortable side effects such as a severe
headache, unequal pupil size, and other pains"
166,6,What is the consequence of bleeding into the subarachnoid ,"Bleeding into the subarachnoid space can slow the normal blood flow to the brain. This is because the pressure inside the subarachnoid space is usually lower than the blood pressure in arteries. When blood leaks into the subarachnoid space, its pressure goes up, squeezing the brain, making it harder to pump blood into the brain, and the result is the blood does not flow in fast enough to meet the needs of the brain. This is why some people drop to the ground unconscious when their red subarachnoid stroke first happens."
167,6,what are symptoms of aneurysm bursts in the subarachnoid space,"Here are a few of the common symptoms
+A pop: A few patients report hearing or feeling a pop inside their head
when an aneurysm ruptures
+ Unconsciousness: Right after the rupture, about half of the patients
become unconscious and remain so for more than an hour. Many are
unconscious for less time. Some patients do not regain consciousness
for several days. Some die before they awaken.
+Headache
+Brain injury"
168,6,Does sah affect the heart?,"SAH sometimes causes heart problems. The heart is controlled by areas deep
in the base of the brain, where most aneurysms are found. Perhaps the blood
injures the brain’s control mechanism for the heart. One of the heart problems that may develop is abnormal rhythm. The heart skips beats or contracts in a frantic, disorganized rhythm that pumps no blood. This can be
fatal. Evidence of injury to the heart resembling a heart attack is also found
in some people with subarachnoid hemorrhage"
169,6,what happen after an sah stroke,"You have a 25-percent chance of having a seizure in the first 24 hours after a subarachnoid hemorrhage. Most seizures occur immediately after the bleeding starts. Brain seizures are thought to be caused by the blood irritating the surface of the brain. When blood escapes from blood vessels, it provokes an intense response to the organs and internal mechanisms it contacts. Seizures result in the case of contact with the brain; spasms occur when the blood contacts the outside of the brain arteries"
170,6,What are the consequences of spasm of brain arteries,"Spasm of brain arteries is the major cause of brain injury and death after you
make it to the hospital. This spasm occurs in about 30 to 40 percent of SAH
patients. It starts to occur between 3 and 21 days after the stroke, usually
between days 4 and 14"
171,6,How to treat the SAH stroke,"So far, no treatments are available for help in the first few minutes after the aneurysm bursts. This type of
stroke gets people’s attention, and most victims are taken to the emergency
room immediately by ambulance.
The good news is that, if the patient survives the initial onset, SAH is one of
the most treatable forms of stroke. A stroke team may make the initial evaluation, but when it comes to treating red stroke — especially SAH red stroke —
a neurosurgeon will be called in. This is because some of the most critical
treatments for subarachnoid bleeding involve surgical procedures to the
brain. Other treatments for SAH complications such as brain swelling and
artery spasm may involve drugs"
172,7,How can you tell whether someone is suffering from stroke-caused dementia?,"Here
are some warning signals of brain failure
 +Loss of memory
 +Confusion in complex situations
 +Loss of control of emotions
 +Problems with communication or expressing self
 +Trouble paying attention
 +Difficulty following a conversation
 +Struggling to work finely with hands
 +Disorganization in plans
 +Failure to recognize things seen
 +Straining with calculations
 +Inability to solve problems
 +Loss of interest in activities that were once important

"
173,7,Does the dementia is a gradual process?,"The onset of dementia is often so gradual it’s hard to recognize at first. Dayto-day or even week-to-week changes may go unnoticed. But the changes
month to month and year to year are more apparent, particularly to those
who haven’t seen the afflicted individual in a while"
174,7,What are the hallmark symptom of memory loss?,"after more
injuries, you can’t recall a particular memory at all. What you experience is slower service from your brain, then one day something you think you
should know is suddenly gone altogether. It’s not so much gone as inaccessible"
175,7,What are the effects  of memory loss after a stroke,"The dementia caused by several strokes is likely to have a pronounced effect
on movement and language — more so than Alzheimer’s disease. Just like the
sudden and dramatic types of stroke that send you to the emergency room,
small strokes cause similar damage only at a less perceptible level. So, in
addition to problems with thinking and memory, a series of small strokes may
leave you with hand weakness or difficulty speaking. You may begin to have
trouble walking or driving. Balancing the checkbook may become a challenge.
Emotions may be harder to control. Because the brain is not receiving all the
information it is used to, the sufferer may become less trusting and more suspicious of others."
176,7,How to diagnose the Stroke-Related Dementia,"If you have a stroke, you call 911 and go to the emergency room because of
the sudden and dramatic signs that define a stroke
Checking in for a check-up.If you have any evidence that your memory and brain power may be failing —
especially if you also suffer from high blood pressure, high cholesterol, or
diabetes — make an appointment for testing"
177,7,How to address risk factors of stroke,"simple blood cholesterol and blood lipid tests (for diabetes) to the battery of other blood tests you’re taking to rule out other cause
And, for atrial
defibrillation, have an ultrasound test of your carotid artery — the artery in
your neck. This test will indicate if the blood is ineffectively pumping to your
brain"
178,7,what are methods to prevent stroke,"Here are true stroke-prevention steps
+Lower your blood pressure
+Fight blood clots with drugs
+Get in shape
+Bring down your cholesterol and lipids
+Get your diabetes under control
+And please don’t tell me you still smoke"
179,8,could you tell me about high blood pressure,"Blood pressure is recorded as two numbers: the highest (systolic) pressure during a heartbeat over the lowest (diastolic) pressure between beats. For instance, your doctor may tell you that your blood pressure is 120 over 80 and write it down as 120/80. (That, by the way, would be good news for you — as this is an average blood pressure reading.) The highest number, the systolic pressure, is given first. If you accidentally reverse it, doctors will smile at you like you said goodbye instead of hello"
180,8,How to check the blood pressure,"It’s simple to determine whether your blood pressure is high. You’re familiar with the little Velcro sleeve the nurse slips on your upper arm. As the nurse presses the rubber pump, the sleeve tightens, and you watch the needle swing up and tick down before it rests at the magic number."
181,8,Who’s at Risk for High Blood Pressure,"High blood pressure isn’t the result of a single cause. Some circumstances you can’t control — your age or your family history, for example. Others may require lifestyle changes or medical solutions. In any event, you’ll benefit by knowing the range of conditions that may lead to high blood pressure"
182,8,What other factors cause high blood pressure?,"Problems with your kidneys may raise your blood pressure. They play a
major role in controlling your blood pressure by controlling the volume of
blood and the amount of sodium and potassium in the blood. Any disease
of the kidneys may affect blood pressure. It is particularly critical if you are
young and have especially high blood pressure to check out your kidneys"
183,8,"Does the drugs that may lead to high
blood pressure ?","Many medications contain chemicals that can raise blood pressure. Here a few of the most common offenders:
 +High doses of aspirin and similar drugs
 +Decongestants
 +Diet aids
 +Steroids
"
184,8,What are the benefits of treating blood pressure?," For people who have never
had a stroke, treating blood pressure cuts the risk of stroke nearly in half. In
older patients, treating people with systolic high blood pressure reduces
the chances of dementia  by half. If you’ve had a stroke, the
chances you will have a second one are reduced by 30 percent if you treat
your high blood pressure"
185,8,How to prevent the high blood pressure,"If you’re overweight, consume an unhealthy menu of high-sodium and highfat foods, and you avoid regular exercise, you may be able to lower your blood pressure by making some positive lifestyle changes. Even if you are
recovering from a stroke, you can follow these recommendations:
 +Exercise enough to make you breathe faster.
 +Get your weight under control.
 +Eat more fruits high in potassium (such as cantaloupe, bananas, apricots, and oranges).
 +Restrict your sodium intake by cutting back on table salt.
 +Consume low-fat dairy products to increase your calcium.
 +Enjoy alcohol up to one or two drinks per day but avoid more.
 +Avoid cold tablets and diet drugs that have warnings about high blood
pressure.
"
186,8,what are the drugs for  lowering blood pressure,"Most doctors will start treating high blood pressure with one of two inexpensive and effective drugs that have very few side effects and are well-tolerated
by most people with high blood pressure. These drugs are the diuretics and
beta blockers. But there are dozens of alternatives."
187,8,Does the sleep apnea is a sign of high blood pressure,"Patients with sleep apnea often have high blood
pressure. It’s not known whether treatment will
reduce blood pressure"
188,9,"
What is the effect of obesity on stroke?","Researchers continue to explore the relationship between fat and atherosclerosis, heart disease, and stroke
Some studies have showed that people who ate more cholesterol had more heart disease"
189,9,What types of fats cause stroke?,"the two major forms of fat we find in the body and in the
food we take into our body
+ Cholesterol
+Triglycerides
"
190,9,"How does fat affect blood vessels?
","These fats and their bodyguard
lipoproteins can irritate the sensitive lining of your blood vessels
Once irritated, the blood vessels can become increasingly
inflamed, scarred, and overlaid with potholes and patches. Eventually, the
atherosclerotic plaque ruptures and blocks the vessel entirely or becomes so
rough that stroke-causing clots form there. Either way, white stroke can
result"
191,9,How do you know you’re at risk for stroke because of high cholesterol,"Not
necessarily from the numbers on your bathroom scale — though if you’re
carrying a spare tire around your waist, that may be a bad sign. But getting a
sense of the shape you’re in is a starting point. Checking your blood for levels
of cholesterol and its components is the next step"
192,9,can you tell me about diet and cholesterol Control to prevent stroke,"Following a diet low in cholesterol and saturated and trans fats is a smart
move"
193,9,What’s the right diet to prevent stroke,"For anyone who wants to control their blood lipids, I recommend one of two
courses: If you’re diabetic, follow a diabetic diet that not only controls the fats
in your diet but also controls the total number of calories, avoiding rapidly
absorbed sugar
If you’re not diabetic, follow the American
Heart Association diet recommendations, which include limiting saturated
and trans fats, substituting low-fat dairy products for their whole-milk counterparts, and eating a greater proportion of calories in fruits, vegetables, and
grains"
194,9,What is the notice of Atkins diet,"I hesitate to mention the Atkins diet — you know: low-carb and lots of animal proteins. 
If you’re on this bandwagon, I recommend that you test your blood cholesterol levels frequently. 
I also suggest discussing this with your doctor"
195,9,How statins work ,"Statins stop your liver from making cholesterol. They don’t stop you from
eating cholesterol, though. Diet and taking statins have to work together to
some extent. "
196,9,What are common statin drugs ,"Commercial Name - Generic Name
Lipitor - Atorvastatin
Zocor - Simvastatin
Pravachol - Pravastatin
Lescol - Fluvastatin
Mevacor - Lovastatin"
197,9,What are drugs that I should not use while having muscle injury,"The problem is worsened by the following drugs: gemfibrozil (Lopid), erythromycin, drugs to kill
fungus infections, and nefazodone (Serzone), an antidepressant."
198,9,How worse the muscle injury can be ,"if the pain gets worse and the muscles become tender, the muscle cells can start to die."
199,9,Does all reduce cholesterol drugs can be used for liver damage,"Other drugs that reduce cholesterol can make liver problems worse. One of
 these drugs is gemfibrozil (Lopid). 
In high doses, the B vitamin niacin does a
 pretty good job of lowering cholesterol, but beware adding it to statins."
